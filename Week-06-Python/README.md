# 🐍 Week 6: Python - CS50x 2026

## 🌟 Overview

This folder contains my solutions for Week 6 of Harvard's CS50x 2025 course, focusing on Python programming. Week 6 introduces Python, a versatile and powerful programming language, emphasizing its syntax, libraries, and applications in solving problems. These exercises enhance my ability to write clean, efficient, and modular code in Python. 🚀

## 🧩 Problem Sets

Below are the problem sets and labs included in this folder, with brief descriptions:

- **Lab 6: World Cup**: A lab simulating a tournament like the World Cup, using Python to model matches and outcomes with random number generation. ⚽
- **Problem Set 6**:
  - **Cash**: A Python program to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to give change, similar to the C version from earlier weeks. 💰
  - **DNA**: A program to identify a person based on their DNA sequence by counting STR (Short Tandem Repeats) matches in a database. 🧬
  - **Hello**: A simple Python script to prompt the user for their name and output a greeting. 👋
  - **Mario**: A program to print a pyramid of hashes, replicating the C-based Mario problem in Python with user input for height. 🏰
  - **Readability**: A Python script to compute the readability level of a text based on the Coleman-Liau formula. 📖

## 📚 Learning Objectives

Through these assignments, I aimed to master the following concepts:

- **Python Syntax**: Writing clear and concise Python code using variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.
- **Data Structures**: Utilizing Python’s built-in data structures like lists, dictionaries, and sets.
- **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files in Python for data processing.
- **Libraries**: Using Python libraries like `random`, `re`, or `sys` for advanced functionality.
- **Problem Solving**: Translating C-based solutions into Python, leveraging its simplicity and power.
- **Debugging**: Using tools like `pdb` or print debugging to troubleshoot Python scripts.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run the Code

To run the programs:

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed (`python3 --version`).
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/KankonNil007/CS50x-2026.git`
3. Navigate to the folder: `cd CS50x-2025/Week-06-Python`
4. Run a program: `python3 program_name.py`
5. For programs requiring arguments (e.g., DNA): `python3 dna.py database.csv sequence.txt`
6. Use CS50 tools like `check50` for testing (e.g., `check50 cs50/problems/2025/x/pset6`) and `style50` for code formatting.

## 💭 Reflections

Week 6 was an exciting transition from C to Python! 🥳 Rewriting programs like Cash and Mario in Python highlighted the language’s simplicity and power, making tasks like file handling and string manipulation much easier. Working with Python’s built-in data structures and libraries opened new ways to approach problems efficiently. These exercises boosted my confidence in writing elegant and readable code.
