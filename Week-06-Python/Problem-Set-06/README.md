# 📝 Problem Set 6: Python

## Overview

This problem set involves revisiting earlier C problems and implementing them in Python, leveraging its concise syntax and powerful libraries. It also includes a DNA analysis problem.

## Problems

### 1. Sentimental (Hello, Mario, Cash, Credit, Readability)

Porting previous C solutions to Python:

- **Hello**: `hello.py`
- **Mario**: `mario-less.py`, `mario-more.py`
- **Cash**: `cash.py`
- **Credit**: `credit.py`
- **Readability**: `readability.py`

### 2. DNA

A program that identifies a person based on their DNA. It queries a CSV database of individuals and their STR (Short Tandem Repeat) counts and matches them against a DNA sequence text file.

- **File**: `dna.py`
