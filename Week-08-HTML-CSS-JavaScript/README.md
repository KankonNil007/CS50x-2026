# 🌐 Week 8: HTML, CSS, JavaScript - CS50x 2026

## 🌟 Overview

This folder contains my solutions for Week 8 of Harvard's CS50x 2025 course, focusing on web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Week 8 introduces the fundamentals of building interactive websites, emphasizing front-end development and client-side programming. These exercises enhance my ability to create responsive, user-friendly web applications. 🚀

## 🧩 Problem Sets

Below are the problem sets and labs included in this folder, with brief descriptions:

- **Lab 8: Trivia**: A lab to build a simple trivia webpage using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, such as handling user inputs and displaying results. ❓
- **Problem Set 8**:
  - **Homepage**: A project to create a personal homepage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating responsive design and dynamic elements like interactive buttons or forms. 🏠
  - **Additional Exercises** (if included): Likely involve enhancing web pages with JavaScript functionality, such as DOM manipulation or event handling. Let me know specific files for updates! 😊

## 📚 Learning Objectives

Through these assignments, I aimed to master the following concepts:

- **HTML**: Structuring web content using semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.
- **CSS**: Styling web pages with layouts (flexbox, grid), responsive design (media queries), and frameworks like Bootstrap (if used).
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity with DOM manipulation, event listeners, and basic logic for dynamic content.
- **Web Development Tools**: Using browser developer tools for debugging and testing web applications.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring websites are accessible and visually appealing across devices.
- **Client-Side Programming**: Handling user interactions without server-side processing.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run the Code

To run the programs:

1. Ensure a modern web browser is installed (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
2. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/KankonNil007/CS50x-2026.git`
3. Navigate to the folder: `cd CS50x-2025/Week-08-HTML-CSS-JavaScript`
4. Open HTML files directly in a browser (e.g., `open index.html` or drag into browser).
5. For local development, use a simple server (e.g., Python’s HTTP server): `python3 -m http.server 8000`, then visit `http://localhost:8000`.
6. Use CS50 tools like `check50` for testing (e.g., `check50 cs50/problems/2025/x/pset8`) and `style50` for code formatting.

## 💭 Reflections

Week 8 was an exciting leap into web development! 🥳 Building interactive webpages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was both creative and technical, bringing static content to life with dynamic features. Creating a personal homepage taught me the importance of responsive design and user experience. These exercises sparked my interest in crafting modern, engaging web applications.
