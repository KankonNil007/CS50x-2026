# 📝 Problem Set 3: Algorithms

## Overview

This problem set explores algorithmic efficiency, sorting, and searching, applying these concepts to voting systems.

## Problems

### 1. Plurality

A program that runs a plurality election, where every voter selects one candidate, and the candidate with the most votes wins.

- **File**: `plurality.c`

### 2. Runoff

A program that implements a ranked-choice voting system. If no candidate has a majority, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the voters' next preferences.

- **File**: `runoff.c`

### 3. Tideman

A program that implements the Tideman (Ranked Pairs) voting method, a complex system that uses graph theory to determine a Condorcet winner, avoiding cycles.

- **File**: `tideman.c`
